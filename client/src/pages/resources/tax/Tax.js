          <h3>What Are Taxes?</h3>
          <p>
            The U.S. government and some states take a portion of what people earn in the U.S., so called taxes, to pay for national, local, or state services and facilities. <br />
            Federal taxes are to be paid to a federal government agency called IRS (Internal Revenue Service) and state taxes to a state tax agency. Make sure to ask for help if you can not find out where to pay or send your taxes to! Your host family or LCC would be a great first resource.

          <h3>Is It Necessary for Me to Pay Taxes?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>YES</strong>. Do not get confused by other au pairs saying you do not have to pay taxes. The U.S. Department of Labor decided in 1994 that an employer-employee relationship exists between host families and au pairs which classifies the au pair stipend as "wages". Therefore, <strong>au pairs owe tax on all of the money they earned within the country</strong>. Be aware that if you choose not to file your tax return, you may ruin your chances of receiving another US visa or Green Card in the future.

          <h3>How Much Will I Have to Pay?</h3>
          <p>
            The exact amount veries every year, but you can expect to pay around 10% of your taxable income for federal taxes. State taxes are much lower and only some states even require you to pay state taxes.

          <h3>Which Form(s) Do I Need to Fill Out?</h3>
          <p>
            You will most likely have to file Form 1040NR-EZ, a federal income tax form for non-residents. There are a few exceptions though! If you were on a different visa before obtaining your J-1, we recommend asking a professional to verify which form you will have to fill out.

          <h3>When Do I Have to Pay?</h3>
          <p>
            Usually, the deadline is April 15th. In rare case, such as the COVID19 pandemic, the deadline might be different. Don't worry, your au pair agency will be able to offer updates and guidance.
